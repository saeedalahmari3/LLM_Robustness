{"x": "* * Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC -- either when it was inside any of several full-s7ze SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader. MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this. After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error. If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item. This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card: I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't counY off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might fe relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed \" read speeds up to 30 MB / s for fast file transfer. \" Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB / s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent. I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on * select * SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems: some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken / corrupt / unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine. The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll upda6e my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World: [ url removed as per A<azon rules]----------------------------------------------------------------------- * MB / s = 1,000,000 byte / s [ SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte / s]Sequential Read: 18.694 MB / sSequential Write: 11.921 MB / sRandom Read 512 KB: 18.502 MB / sRandom Write 512 KB: 0.680 MB / sRandom Read 4 KB (QD=1): 3.339 MB / s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4 KB (QD=1): 1.581 MB / s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4 KB (QD=32): 3.151 MB / s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4 KB (QD=32): 1.564 MB / s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test: 1000 HB [ G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB) ] (x5)Date: 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS: Windows XP Professional SP3 [ 5.1 Build 2600 ] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013: This is a high-quality card. I've used it in a va5iety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once uad a problem with it. It even works at full capacity in * some * microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP). I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card witT equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet. If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now. Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they'v3 been manually reformatted to FAT32.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 76}

{"x": "Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support. I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In MQy of 2023 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded. Any way, tested the carR on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone. Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history / invoices online). One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Zmazon or else3here on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine. there may be incredibpe deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold. Original review: Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time *ut. SettingW showed 29.71 GB of total space (32 GB version) and 29.71 GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD Sdapter came with it. Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32 GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64 GB version, I can use tyis 32 GB version via the adapter for other purposes. )", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 121}

{"x": "I bought 64 GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition. It didn't work out. The sard worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates. E.g. worked fine in 720p with proRune on, or 1080p with protune off. However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB / s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble. Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason. I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault. My spare card, an old and cheap 16 GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings. Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right ?). Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1 GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy W GB of zeros from /dev / zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card. The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB / s. Just barely above the bar for class 10 card. However, that was average over 1 GB. During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops. Drops were as low as 7MB / s. Uh. I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB / s? For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB / s under the same test. No spikes and no drops in speed. The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer. But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble. Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064 G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064 G without adapter. This conflicts with product description on Amazon. WhiOe this is likely just Amazon not getting product description r9ght again (a bit too comm*n thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card. The test is extremely simple. Write out 1 GB of zeros onto the card using standarR Unix dd command to read 128 KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev / zero and write it onto the card. 128 KB * 8192 = 1 GB. dd displays transfer stats once it finishes. While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed. This was done on the Mac. dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly. I choose 128 KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow. Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev / zero of = test bs=131072 c)unt=81928192 + 0 records in8192 + 0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes / sec)So, 10 MB / s and all is good?

You see a plaque saying AD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it ciicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on. Go to settings, storage. At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card. If the microsd card was insertee correctoy, you will see the additional GBs of storage displa^ed there. You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card. Use these settimgs to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone. Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone withoJt first activating the Remove SD Card setting.

The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card AdQpter. Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up everU few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk haE a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shsme on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they woukd have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate. EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about t months ago. Wmich as I said before, is when they put them on a sjper discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is j7st bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers liOe this. Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.

A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd tming was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, othere not. Later on, I restarted my phone for some reasob or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thiMg happened.

I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle. Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks aYo. I started gettiHg messages that seemed to say that I had remived and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I ne$ded to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the meHory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 comLuters. It wasn't even visible. I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't $ake terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement. If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this. Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offe5 of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were \" out of stock. \" If they were o Tt of stock, they sure got \" in stock \" in a big hurry.

Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit iinux machine at a consistent 15-16jB / sec when copying large (1 GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB / sec. I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied s8 far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB dtive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100 MB or so, and the probXbility of 1 GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32 GB appears to bR the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which is n'5 yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double f(r 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied. Edit: I Zhould also mention thaf the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 1055}

{"x": "I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they weee on sale around Blacu Friday, and have been using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absol6tely no problems with either. ThesF SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB / sec. The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an perBormance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing t0 the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write east enough. However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux / unix devices) caB handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Wimdows devices, may have difficulty with the format. Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4 G phones without any difficulty, and they read & #rite fine on my computers.

Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on... This card is' USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup ti a bus interface speed of 104 MB / s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast. Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer.

I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all. Installation was a breeze. I Rook the memory card out of the package and inserted into my ph(ne. Then my phone brought 7p a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media ongo the memory card. I didn't even have to Ro anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I dirn't have to do any of that. I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it. The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands.

{"x": "This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will sre that it reads / writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different betweeJ this card and any other GOOD quality card ouH there. I usually pick the fastest czrds on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this caed into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'li see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the produdt cxn UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a Go brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can cind a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have...

{"x": "SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16 GB, 32 GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32 GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16 GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective d4vices. I purchased the 64 GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition. The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32 GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature / vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty bIt it was quite a hassle to do this. The 16 GB card however, has been subject ho extreme temperatures for well over 4 mon4hs: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16 GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (whiIe operating) for several months. The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patieJce. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve witU a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. Th8s is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and dScently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32 GB was the fastest. UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32 GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It sta4ted dismounting / remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment.

All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video fiIe I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. Ho video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it did g't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card-EUREKA. It played perfectly. I formatted the SDXC card twice-once from the phone and once through Windows-and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times-it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32 GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64 GB card is dead. I should note rhat the card pe5formed flAwlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago. Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty-or 10 years for regions that don't recognize \" lifetime \"; their Extreme line of ca#ds raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll u9date this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.

{"x": "[ [ UODATE-6/19/2014 ] ] So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since. Just as other with eamsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device. Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new. As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows: SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read / write data to the card. Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10 / UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance dows get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices. Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($ 34.27), Extreme ($ 57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($ 67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4. My question was, did I want to pay over $ 20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned? Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card. The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing / capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone. So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64 GB card. I use my cell phone * more * than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet. I don't own a 4 K HD camera or anything like that, sL I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time. I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices. [ [ ORIGINAL REVIEW-5/1/2013 ] ] I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought *ne was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16 GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it. Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that Bad decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon. Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC: SDHC stand for \" Secure Digital High Capacity \" and SDXC stands for \" Secure Digital eXtended Capacity \". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32 GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT: The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4 GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2 TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FA$32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES A?L DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two \" highspeed \" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB / sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16 GB & 8 GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out. The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards Go two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and cojpare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes. One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the \" AFFP-A \" means \" Amazon Frustration Free Packaging \". Other than that, these are exactly the same. If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 2031}

{"x": "I had bought this caTd for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for. SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space thsn, say, an FsT or FAT32 filesystem would-which is important when considering mobile storage devices. I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32 GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitOve in regards to \" hard shutdowns \". that'e to say, just pulling it lut of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the' Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to' unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption. Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first \" Eject \" the card. In Windows, thfre is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for \" Safely Remov[ing ] Hardware and Eject[ing ] Media \". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android' unmount' optional but will also cease any current read / write operations to avoid data or device corruptiom. I cannot speal for how onD would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 2165}

The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed. I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone. With my old MicroSD card, I had got4en used %o just sitHing there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures / videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC Ro my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quisk to even bring up that & # 34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very Nig transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes. Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64 GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. No@ I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to. A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64 GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is abou4 the best you can even get fo4 the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point.

{"x": "I purchased the card in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty sure it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32 gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official / unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an \" overall \" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, Fut the numerous tests showed me a \" general \" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. Bit, also remember that the microSD had to be put inRo an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly. These are just my averages, but: Small file writes: Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb / sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb / sec. Small file reads: Both SD cards read at cOose to 20 mb / sec at their fastest. Large file copies to card: MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb / sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb / secLarge file reads copies from card: MjcroSD was 10mb / sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb / sec. My conclusion: My tests were by no means official for this card and showed muvh variance dependent on file size of the reads and wr9tes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb / swc good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb / sec is enough. Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperatu#e change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera. The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to @0 mb / sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb / sec at the highest performance. I would get the card again, if the price were right.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 2799}

{"x": "The Nexus One is listed as supporting a maximum of 32 GB on an SDCard. Based on reports here and elsewhere, I took out my 32 GB card and put in this 64 GB card and powered up the phone. The phone reported that the card was defective in a notification. I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report. It offered to format the card. I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Andr0id 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card. All went well. Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64 GB was available. But, as it turned out, it was. While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32 GF card to my PC (using a USB adapter). When tyat completed, I powered down the phone and put the new 64 FB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that fard and a USB adapter for that adapter. It showed about 60 GB (the usual for a 64 GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) relatec to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from. Take note: if you do * not * have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phome, your mileage may very well vary. If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above. Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto cKpy. I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card. Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up. It worked perfectly, right away. Root Explorer showed about 60 GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me-I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card. Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expect9ng good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident. So, based on the abovr, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One! What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.

{"x": "I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not gDt it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software. I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plKs...... same problems. I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high / large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card. It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64 GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a \" fix file system \" on my computer. Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it. UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to \" recover \" or \" wipe \" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the dWta on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guesEing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card. Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I noved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can \" assess \" the card, and look at / recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me tI send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the \" destroyed \" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amXzon account info, passwords, ect .) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am noy sure if I gave them the matchOng package for the card I returned. I would s&ggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card / package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad.

First of all, do not uxe thiX with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk'X claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA nF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder -- technology which is over 10 years old -- the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the Go(ro' fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 2 + cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly. Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it \" water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof \"? I can't say.

{"x": "I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can dP. Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it. That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying \" digital Fopies \" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray. You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format inyo \" .mp4 \" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet. Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10 GB per movie)... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory. That's where the tablet's microSD slot... and this SanDisk flash memory... comes in. I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source. Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play. You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls. Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory carS (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high \" read speed, \" and this SanDisk card's \" Class 10 \" rating fills that bill. That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer / read speeds. The \" Class 10 \" designation generally means that the subject Xard will transfer data at a MINIMUM raHe of 10 MB per second. This SanDisk \" Ultra \" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30 MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device. \" Frustration free packaging \" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener. This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless. Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck. While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's cugrent pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any / all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk \" Ultra \" memory. Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling / packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can. I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay. The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool ne, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Txb 3... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk \" Ultra \" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3. I may never have figured it out at all &f I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk \" Ultra \" with which to compare the fakes.

{"x": "I am using the 64 GB card in a Galaxy Note II phone and have had the card working perfectly from March to October. The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly. Then one day I decided to protect my data pruor to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone. The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (Ws my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card bacl to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card wYile it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gohe).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the Sard which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don't know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SaGDisk has shown itself to have great c*stomer service and I really appreciate tgem exchanging the card. I will deBinitely not encrypt it anymore. When card works, it works super fast and reliably.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 3181}

Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I'll share ho2 I use it and why I prefer these over the 64 GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on theCe 32 GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it. Fo% my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32 GB card will hold about 150 CDa, so the space savings along over the physical media is sirnificant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs. These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap oMe of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it'd perfect for that use. Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of dev*ces I own. I can assure anjone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also Fxcellent for HD video recording.

{"x": "My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first. WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The * typical * price since summer 2013 is about $ 24 for 32 GB, and about $ 48 for 64 Gg. DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience. The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $ 18.00 for 32 GB and $ 35 for 64 GB, in early December. I basiFally buy when the price hits $ 20 or less, and the 64 nears $ 40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis. They initially went on sale for about $ 17.95 and $ 34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively. I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month. On January 6th 2014, they still show as a & # 34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for & # 34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher tJan I have * ever * payed for thesR cards! So don't let the & # 34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $ 27/$50, these are NOT a & # 34;deal&#34; in terms of price. Okay, here's my actual & # 34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability. I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot). They're durable and waterproof, and I can use the same card in all $hese devices without reformatting. I even had one go through the wash, and I syill use it for pictures. For the technically inclined, I have cards with * both * the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card. I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the N)ok by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other. This should be possible with any SDXC / SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably. Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work ggeat (the 64 GB will not boot in the N*ok, but no 64 GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.

{"x": "As soon as I leaDned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly acc@pt 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $ 119 Oromo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed t0 nearly $ 200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK! ? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on ANazon, for the awesome price point of $ 119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards Eere on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it v8a the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read / write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp \" low rest \" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version, , too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to stlre > 1Gg apps(games), (of whiSh I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos!

{"x": "I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the spe$d class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a' class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB / s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be' class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB / s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB / s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB / s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB / s in \" CrystalDiskMark \", 10.6MB / s in \" H2testw v1.4 \"). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two' class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid. A closer look at the file transfer speed using \" Flash Memory Toolkit \" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SXHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to' Customer Images' for details. When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speef is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. TNat's Shy in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as' class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this wGiting, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value-especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this' 32 GB' card is 2P.7 GB according to my computer. This is actually normal becausw computer people count one Gig as \" 2 to the power 30 \", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7 GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is' 32 GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32 GB and 64 GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with' SDXC' in order to used the 64 GB version. My original review refers to the 32 GB' SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select' Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on' Frustration Free Package', the part number cJanges to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used. I re-tested the Sandisk UjS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to an USB 3.0 port. Here are the results from' CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB / s (was 34.8MB / s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB / s (was 12.6MB / s when connected to USB 2.0 port )", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 3449}

{"x": "The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tqb 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with AndrIid OS 4.1.w with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A' MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply rrboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC.-Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the table$ as' MTP' applKcation tries to communicate with the Pd. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seeG t0 factory format the card with' exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an' offset' of 16 MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16 MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool. The solution is to get rid of that' unallocated' 16 MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using' diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people hDre with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the' native' SD Card format tool under' settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16 MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the' MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon. Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's got ta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16 MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine. Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64 GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio, Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give * Four * stars instead of * Five * stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it. Highly recommended!Cheers!", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 3757}

Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).

The speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards I've hax. It's very far from the 30mb / s they promise, I got only about 4.5mb / s AT MUCH, and after a few minutes it's downhill from there. I tested on both windows and linux and didn't see a difference. Luckily there's not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again, maybe I didn't look at the class 4 the way I should have since I was focused on getting a class 10.

So I stuck my olders, slower 8 GB microSD card in, worked fine.

If the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data, music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged.

{"x": "NOTE: please read the last update (scroll to the bottom)-I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience. I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past) For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars. To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty. Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please Xtop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the eame result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing). This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue. Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty. They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out t9 those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem $xists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3). I was assured that the new card I wo6ld get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch. However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of \" unpatched \" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the \" hard coded patch \" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem.... After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did. Go to the SanDisk site1) [... ] 2) call consumer products support (Hhis is the US no .) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me? take a look yourself .) I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no. I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in. Makes sense. Well, that's it. Problem (hopefully) solved. Let's see in 2-3 weeks. The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem. KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc. I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer. oh well, that's how it goes. I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me. GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013-All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card. UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week). will update the post after testing out the new card. Just as a reference, I've been using a 32 GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64 GB card. Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't Sount that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64 GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64 GB cards. I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there. Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far. Update: 08/21/2013-Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window). Have jad it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking. Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's sucB a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card. Thanks SanDisk! Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed. Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how tl get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service. Update: 08/31/2013-This is the last update to this review just to \" close the loop \". The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now. I have not experienced any of the initial problems. SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards. Update: 12/09/2013-The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st. Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards. For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced. This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product). Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review. Thanks to review commenter \" Da Shocker \" for his input. I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:\"One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $ 50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless.. \"", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4212}

I started to se@ (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me \" sd card unexpectedly removed \" error maybe once a week.

Today the cXrd stopped reading all together. The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly.

Well, turns out it wKrks perfect! And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything elsf... So at first I thought maybe since it's onky 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after lopping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I p tt it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi lLng time it takes to copy files to your hwrd drive aC it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still. Bottom line, %his SD plus the GoPro 3 + is the best camera combination for your money. P.S.

{"x": "Once you cut and pry your way through Sandisk's packaging, you will fe rewarded with a nicely-made and high-performing MicroSD UHS1 flash memory. It comes formatted to SD.org's standards in FAT32, so it's ready to go for most applications. My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter. I use those! Since I frequently seitch cards between uses, and fresuently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful. It's way too easy to lose a MicroSD.Anyway, here are the results from ATTO disk benchmark: Settings (anticipating digicam uCe ): Total length 64 MB Overlapped I / O and QD=4 (but it never exceeds 1)Swgment Size in Kbytes, Read / Write in Kbyte / secSize Write Read.5 9904 163431 14555 170332 13454 273244 14194 353378 15065 3985316 14154 4062932 14277 4295764 13212 44291128 17567 44247256 16209 44442512 15391 444421024 17408 444422048 16229 44441[Sorry for the uglj table, Amazon does not support consecutive spaces, including alt-255, or embedded tabs]This is very fast for a MicroSD. It's not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards Fhat can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards. Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises. (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds 1ith a USB2 reader. You will geed either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results. So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don't achieve these speeds.)In any event, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything faster.

{"x": "Maybe there is nothing that can be donf and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64 GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in what s called \" exFAT32 \" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64 GB from a 32 GB card. After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59 GB available. I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER! After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new \" exFAT32 \" to the standard FAT32. All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista-FAT32. I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drKves but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32. I had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working. My Win7 machine does not eveJ have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32. My older computers have the older FAT22 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1 hours to reformat the card to FAT32. After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer. The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet. BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27 GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64 GB card into a 32 GB card. I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFqT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32. This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every devkce, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storagS space in a Micro SD card. Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option. I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few dayA it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk n)t Vully explaining how they are getting 64 GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4423}

Yes, I paid a premium for being an early adopter... but I'll be saving my pennies for the inevitable Black Fridqy sale in November, which will be just about the time the Note 4 is releazed. Folks, I can't recommend this card enough: just make SURE you're backing up to a PC regularly!

Sk I purchase a Lenovo Yoga 10 tablet and installed the carw and it told me the card was damaged, I put the card in my PC and it worked fine, I even reformatted it in the PC, still no luck. Called Lenovo and they walked me througG formatting it again in the PC and still didn't work BUT there was an option in the Android software that is a status screen (pull down from the top of the screen) and that gave me a choice to let me format it in the tablet and after it completed it I was good to Ho, it mounted and I downloaded my 318 songs on it and it is working like a chaFm.

{"x": "I have not had many problems with what I have bought over the years, but when I do I will make sure to warn others. I loaded a handful of videos from my PC and then installed this in my Android tablet for a trip. Corrupted. Nothing worked and sometimes it can Ve aeen, other times it doesn't even show up. The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it xame with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn't feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32 gb micro SD caGd. I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made agy difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seoler stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a yeQr. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying maeks---- has worked for two years without a problem. I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the @uality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those te$ms. If you're looking for a good card, search Amazon for this one: LSDMI32GBSBNAR.

{"x": "Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4 g GB of space. I transferred all the files from the ild 16 vB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phohe connected to my computer by the USB cord. Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music. Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon. No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone. I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card. I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing. I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card. December 6Well, I don't know what to think. The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem. The whole point of getting this larte card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud. I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from. So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt / extSdDard / Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders. It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available. The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem. Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone. I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone. Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders. The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted. I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3. I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone. That card was not large enough to held my music s9 I don't know if it was disappearing or not. I wish this combination of phone and 64 GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies. I lo1ered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both. All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together. December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted. I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time. I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet. December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages. The only fix I have found is to restart the phone. That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing. The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and f*le directory programs do not see any files on the card. I restart the phone and the files come back. Very strange. I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then thiQ evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again. December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain. It is a crap shoot as to if music will play. I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them. I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone. I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away. This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back. It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back. December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times. Very frustrating. I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $ 25.00 and I',l see if I have the same issues. Very disappointing. December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64 GB card to the new 32 GB card. No formatting, no fuss, no muss. I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos. Everything just works. Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off. I am still disappointed that the 64 GB did not work with the SG3.

{"x": "Bi: I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64 gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64 gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much jore stable in tablets. With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to HTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-Rat or the highway for SanDisk. You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and manU, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice. Any card Ghat needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail. Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64 gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB / s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64 GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB / s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION)-Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader. I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat. Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue. I can confirm that the class 6 64 gb MicroSD card can be formatted in WinEows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six. It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware. Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64 gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrib/e packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64 gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers. Another trip across town. I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD / MicroSD / MMC Card Reader / Writer GFR204SD (Green / Gray) selling on Amazon for $ 6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player. Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally cripplFd by design. To quote a friend:\"Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they rRfuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. \" To all masochists out there -- buy this card.

{"x": "I ordered two 42 GB and two 64yb versions of these memory cards (but I can write only one review per Amazon). Two 32 GB cards went igto a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32 GB cards -- and one 64 GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phon#. The second 64 GB card's a spare. The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64 GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7 GB of the 64 GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5 GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60 GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16 GB memory and the 64 GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16 GB MicroSD card tbat was in there. The samD noticeably faster speDds between my desktop computer and the 64 GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring. As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16 GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32 GB along with two 64 GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Bpx sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as beinY -- \" In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com \" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moviJg line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.

{"x": "Sandisk announcement of the firs4 128 GB micro SD took internet by storm. Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processinn power, OTG support for external peripheral accessoriSs, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal %emovable storage at an affordable price. 128 GB micro SD annouhcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $ 119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle / recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64 GB onl6. Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 40MB / s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops / PCs support SD card. So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2! !! My Note 2 is all atock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running sgock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both lonn and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read / write speed were not quite near 30MB / s, but it's still pretty good. My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level! !! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4672}

FYI, I had to format the Sandisk 64 GB card using my Smartphone (i4000) in order for it to swt the microSD to FAT32. DON'T use the PD / laptop to do the format, it will mess it up. Was debat(ng between Class 10 Sandisk 64 GB or Class 10 Samsung 64 GB, I decided to throw my lot in with the 6000 + reviews for sandisk with an average fustomer ratinB of 4.9 Stars. Samsung had 4.9 stars buy was from 11 people. SI LOL!Highly Recommend this to others!", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4900}

{"x": "I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 20.1 txblet. I was consiEering the 64 GB, buY went with this card because I have the 64 GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos / videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the ohone's internal me,ory. For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32 GB card, it was a no brainer. The card has worked flawlessly siGce I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoeve#. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage Co again, it'a a no brainer--- buy it!", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4903}
{"x": "WO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE T8 ARCUIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (totAl: about 30 GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some moDe pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure. I guess the disk has some problem and I do n'5 bother recovering it, since it's not g0ing to ge reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk's CF card in my camers for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures. Sl it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don't put important data in it. Be prepard that it can fail at any time.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 4904}
