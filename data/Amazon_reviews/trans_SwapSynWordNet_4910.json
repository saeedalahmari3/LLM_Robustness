MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this. After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect misplay. If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my followup is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item. This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card: I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I coiffen't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed \" read speeds upwardly to 30 MB / s for fast file transfer. \" Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB / s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent. I only just got the card this week, and therefore far it works on * select * SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems: some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken / corrupt / unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine. The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World: [ url removed as per virago rules]----------------------------------------------------------------------- * MB / s = 1,000,000 byte / s [ SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte / s]Sequential Read: 18.694 MB / sSequential Write: 11.921 MB / sRandom Read 512 KB: 18.502 MB / sRandom Write 512 KB: 0.680 MB / sRandom Read 4 KB (QD=1): 3.339 MB / s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4 KB (QD=1): 1.581 MB / s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4 KB (QD=32): 3.151 MB / s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4 KB (QD=32): 1.564 MB / s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test: 1000 MB [ G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB) ] (x5)Date: 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS: Windows XP Professional SP3 [ 5.1 Build 2600 ] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013: This is a high-quality card. I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it. It even works at full capacity in * some * microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP). I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet. If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now. Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is unrivalled of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 76}

{"x": "Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support. I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my sail to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded. Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them transcript of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone. Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide substantiation of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history / invoices online). One reason I buy straightaway from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine. there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit plug-in are being sold. Original review: Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting require. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71 GB of total space (32 GB version) and 29.71 GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it. Should I ever need to enclose the card into my laptop it will come in handy.

{"x": "I bought 64 GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition. It didn't work out. The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates. e.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off. However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB / s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble. Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious rationality. I first suspected camera, but testing with unlike SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault. My spare card, an old and cheap 16 GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings. Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right ?). Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1 GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1 GB of zeros from /dev / zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card. The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB / s. Just barely above the bar for class 10 card. yet, that was average over 1 GB. During the write test, the amphetamine was oscillating with many spikes and drops. Drops were as low as 7MB / s. Uh. I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB / s? For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB / s under the same test. No spikes and no drops in speed. The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer. But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble. Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064 G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064 G without adapter. This conflicts with product description on Amazon. While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card. The test is extremely simple. Write out 1 GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128 KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev / zero and write it onto the card. 128 KB * 8192 = 1 GB. dd displays transport stats once it finishes. While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying unity second interval stats as a measure of current speed. This was done on the Mac. dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly. I choose 128 KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow. Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev / zero of = run bs=131072 count=81928192 + 0 records in8192 + 0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes / sec)So, 10 MB / s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB / t tps MB / s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36 [... and so on until dd finishes writing 1 GB of zeros to the card... ] IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB / s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64 GB micro-SD card:$ DD if=/dev / zero of = test bs=131072 count=81928192 + 0 record in8192 + 0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes / sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB / t tps MB / s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11 [... and so on until dd finishes writing 1 GB of zeros to the card... ] So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made certain to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad plenty with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't cost buying whatsoever more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous nonstarter rate. EDIT: After submitting my review I did around more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super rebate sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your client something that is going to fail at an unacceptable pace and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is exactly bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this. Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.

It didn't assume terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they speedily offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them.

The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.

I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the origin. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB ride that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100 MB or so, and the probability of 1 GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32 GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not office of any explicit sale, but definitely a low-pitched cost than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied. Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 1055}

{"x": "I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they were on sale around Black Friday, and have cost using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problem with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB / sec. The UHS class unity designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the plug-in is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are utilize a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR camera, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified twist is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough. However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux / unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the formatting. stimulate said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4 G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write finely on my computers.

Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...

All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card-EUREKA. It run perfectly. I formatted the SDXC card twice-once from the phone and once through Windows-and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times-it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the plug-in for my older, Sandisk Ultra xxxii GB Micro SDXC card. Like conjuration, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yea, the 64 GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few day ago.

{"x": "[ [ UPDATE-6/19/2014 ] ] So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since. Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device. Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new. As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows: SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read / write data to the card. Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10 / UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices. Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($ 34.27), Extreme ($ 57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($ 67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4. My question was, did I want to pay over $ 20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned? Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card. The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing / capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone. So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64 GB card. I use my cell phone * more * than I do my lozenge and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet. I don't own a 4 K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time. I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices. [ [ ORIGINAL REVIEW-5/1/2013 ] ] I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 days ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung wandflower S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16 GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it. Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon. Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have unlike model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC: SDHC stand for \" Secure Digital High Capacity \" and SDXC stands for \" Secure Digital eXtended Capacity \". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32 GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT: The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of quatern GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, patronize file sizes up to 2 TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two \" highspeed \" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB / second, however they are SDHC only. To make things sorry, they are currently only available in 16 GB & 8 GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out. The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you fetch exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes. One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the \" AFFP-A \" means \" Amazon Frustration Free Packaging \". Other than that, these are exactly the like. If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 2031}

SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to arrange it As anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would-which is important when considering mobile storage devices. I read several poor followup about this intersection initiate that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32 GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to \" hard shutdowns \". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the' Data Storage' menu on Android phones, thither is an option to' unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the plug-in itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption. Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first \" Eject \" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification carte for \" Safely Remov[ing ] Hardware and Eject[ing ] Media \". Select the card and a notification will kill-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android' unmount' optional but will also cease any current read / write operations to avoid data or twist corruption.

{"x": "I purchased the plug-in in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty certain it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32 gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official / unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an \" overall \" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a \" general \" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. only, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly. These are just my averages, but: Small file writes: Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb / sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb / sec. Small file reads: Both SD cards read at close to 20 Mbit / sec at their fastest. Large file copies to card: MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb / sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb / secLarge file reads copies from card: MicroSD was 10mb / sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb / sec. My conclusion: My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar plenty. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb / sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb / sec is enough. Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any obtrusive heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've comment that it has been a complaint from many multitude on the web, some stating that they felt they might cauterise themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not establish in a camera. The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people.

The sound account that the card was defective in a notification. I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report. It offered to format the card. I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card. All went well. Since I had miss to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64 GB was available. But, as it turned out, it was. While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a transcript of the contents of my xxxii GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter). When that completed, I power down the phone and put the new 64 GB card in the microcomputer using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter. It showed about 60 GB (the usual for a 64 GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had cost placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from. Take note: if you do * not * have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary. If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above. Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy. I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card. Then, I put the new card in the N1 and power it up. It worked perfectly, right away. Root Explorer showed about 60 GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me-I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card. Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident. So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One! What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.

{"x": "I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software. I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus...... same problems. I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high / large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card. It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and gratefully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64 GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a \" fix file system \" on my estimator. Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it. UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have non tried to \" recover \" or \" wipe \" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a society, not knowing WHO will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card. Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone regretful, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short sentence periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can \" assess \" the card, and look at / recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can infer. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the \" destroyed \" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect .) I would have just kept the card, demolish it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned. I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card / package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad.

{"x": "I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do. Once she did, that led, of form, to her wanting to watch movies on it. That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying \" digital copies \" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray. You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into \" .mp4 \" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet. Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to cost pretty large (average 5 to 10 GB per movie)... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory. That's where the tablet's microSD slot... and this SanDisk flash memory... comes in. I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source. Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play. You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls. Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a remembering card (rather than the tablet's internal remembering) requires a memory card with very high \" read speed, \" and this SanDisk card's \" Class 10 \" rating fills that bill. That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer / read speeds. The \" Class 10 \" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10 MB per second. This SanDisk \" Ultra \" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30 MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device. \" Frustration free packaging \" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener. This card fare pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless. Finally, don't get yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck. While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any / all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk \" Ultra \" memory. Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling / packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus bit on Ebay and anywhere else they can. I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay. The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the wandflower Tab 3... the write speed (that is, the amount of sentence it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk \" Ultra \" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for run movies on the Galaxy Tab 3. I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk \" Ultra \" with which to compare the fakes. If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further... this is it.", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 2993}

{"x": "My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first. WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD along SALE!The * typical * price since summer 2013 is about $ 24 for 32 GB, and about $ 48 for 64 GB. DO NOT bear any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience. The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $ 18.00 for 32 GB and $ 35 for 64 GB, in early December. I basically buy when the price hits $ 20 or less, and the sixty-four nears $ 40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis. They initially went on sale for roughly $ 17.95 and $ 34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively. I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month. On January 6th 2014, they still show as a & # 34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for & # 34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price period since last summer -- and higher than I have * ever * bear for these cards! So don't get the & # 34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $ 27/$50, these are NOT a & # 34;deal&#34; in terms of price. Okay, here's my actual & # 34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability. I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot). They're durable and waterproof, and I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting. I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures. For the technically inclined, I have cards with * both * the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card. I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other. This should be possible with any SDXC / SDHC card, simply it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably. Some cards won't boot because they're besides slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64 GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64 GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me. Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of & # 34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.

{"x": "As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one extinct. The $ 119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $ 200, AND THEY cost OUT OF STOCK! ? I yearn. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome cost point of $ 119! I pulled the trigger immediately! advantageously, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in cost a little wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read / write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp \" low-pitched rest \" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version, , too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store > 1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of movie, and 1080p videos! I'd say, that if your sound accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer!", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 3448}
{"x": "I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a' class-10' rating mean the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB / s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be' class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB / s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB / s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 plug-in (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB / s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB / s in \" CrystalDiskMark \", 10.6MB / s in \" H2testw v1.4 \"). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two' class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid. A closer look at the file transfer speed using \" Flash Memory Toolkit \" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to' Customer paradigm' for details. When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as' class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value-especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this' 32 G' card is 29.7 GB according to my computer. This is really normal because computer multitude count one Gig As \" 2 to the power 30 \", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7 GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is' 32 GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32 GB and 64 GB cards on the same intersection page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with' SDXC' in order to used the 64 GB version. My original review refers to the 32 GB' SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select' Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on' Frustration Free Package', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the plug-in reader and USB 2.0 port used. I re-tested the Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to an USB 3.0 port. Here are the results from' CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB / s (was 34.8MB / s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB / second (was 12.6MB / s when connected to USB 2.0 port )", "y": "NA", "sample_id": 3449}

{"x": "The primary rationality for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra sixty-four GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android oxygen 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences May vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A' MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC.-Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted exactly fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as' MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I set the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with' exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an' offset' of 16 MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16 MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool. The solution is to get rid of that' unallocated' 16 MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using' diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and utilize the' native' SD Card format tool under' settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16 MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the' MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon. Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never coiffe it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's got ta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16 MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine. Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64 GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio, Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above thrust Maine to give * Four * stars instead of * Five * stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.

{"x": "NOTE: please read the last update (scroll to the bottom)-I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience. I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past) For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars. To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty. Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing). This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you see the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk experience about this issue. Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty. They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (good-for-naught SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked finely in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3). I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch. However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old plenty of \" unpatched \" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the \" hard coded patch \" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem.... After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did. Go to the SanDisk site1) [... ] 2) call consumer products support (this is the US no .) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me? take a look yourself .) I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no. I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in. Makes gumption. Well, that's it. Problem (hopefully) solved. Let's see in 2-3 weeks. The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem. KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was around type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc. I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer. oh well, that's how it goes. I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me. GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013-All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card. UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card stimulate been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week). will update the post after testing out the new card. Just as a reference, I've been using a 32 GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64 GB card. Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence wherefore the 64 GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64 GB cards. I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there. Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far. Update: 08/21/2013-Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window). Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking. Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card. Thanks SanDisk! Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed. Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service. Update: 08/31/2013-This is the last update to this review just to \" close the loop \". The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now. I have not experienced any of the initial problems. SanDisk really did mend the issues in the new batch of cards. Update: 12/09/2013-The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st. Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards. For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced. This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product). Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review. Thanks to review commenter \" Da Shocker \" for his input. I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:\"One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star.

The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards. Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.

{"x": "Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64 GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in what s called \" exFAT32 \" instead of the standard FAT32 to get sixty-four GB from a 32 GB card. After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59 GB available. I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER! After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new \" exFAT32 \" to the standard FAT32. All my files were created in profits XP and Win Vista-FAT32. I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this plug-in from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32. I had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working. My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32. My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core CPU 1 hours to reformat the card to FAT32. After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 estimator. The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet. BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27 GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64 GB card into a 32 GB card. I will keep the plug-in because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an oxygen is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32. This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better dispatch just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card. Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option. I have non tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems similar it would work if exFAT32 works for you.

{"x": "Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4 g GB of space. I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord. Still lots of space leave and the various music players seem to see wholly the music. Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card coiffen't show up on the phone this afternoon. No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone. I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card. I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been lose. I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card. December 6Well, I don't know what to think. The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem. The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud. I try several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from. So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt / extSdCard / Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders. It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available. The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the trouble. Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone. I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone. Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders. The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted. I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3. I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone. That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it cost disappearing or not. I wish this combination of phone and 64 GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies. I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both. All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together. December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted. I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time. I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet. December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages. The only fix I have found is to restart the phone. That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing. The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card. I restart the phone and the files come back. Very strange. I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again. December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain. It is a crap shoot as to if music will play. I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them. I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone. I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away. This morning the SD card came upwardly as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back. It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back. December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my sound has reset several times. Very frustrating. I order a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $ 25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues. Very disappointing. December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64 GB card to the new 32 GB card. No formatting, no fuss, no muss. I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos. Everything just works. Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off. I am still disappointed that the 64 GB did not work with the SG3.

{"x": "Hi: I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64 gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64 gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets. With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk. You can use EaseUS Partition Master to arrange the plug-in to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-husband-fat is the only choice. Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail. Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64 gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB / s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A equally well as SanDisk 64 GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB / s memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION)-Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader. I did not have any success formatting the form 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was unable to format the plug-in with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat. Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only utilize MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue. I can confirm that the class 6 64 gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 plug-in, I'm back to class six. It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware. Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64 gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64 gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers. Another trip across town. I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD / MicroSD / MMC Card Reader / Writer GFR204SD (Green / Gray) selling on Amazon for $ 6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player. Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design. To quote a friend:\"Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 G and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. \" To all masochists out there -- buy this card.

Two 32 GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which alone accept upwardly to 32 GB cards -- and one 64 GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64 GB card's a spare. The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64 GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7 GB of the 64 GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5 G of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60 GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16 GB memory and the 64 GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16 GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster amphetamine between my desktop computer and the 64 GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring. As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and look to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16 GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32 GB on with deuce 64 GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for quatern tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon pageboy as being -- \" In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com \" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.

Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable cost. 128 GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $ 119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle / recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64 GB only. Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB / s and Class x performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a twinkling plug-in itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops / PCs support SD card. So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2! !! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the plug-in first with an adapter on my laptop and so mount it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read / write speed were not quite near 30MB / second, but it's still pretty good. My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next storey! !! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on.
